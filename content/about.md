## Leadership

The Urbana-Champaign UseR (UC-UR) Group is an all-volunteer organization
founded in October 2019 by 
[James Balamuta](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/),
[David Dalpiaz](https://daviddalpiaz.com/), [Ha Nguyen](http://www.haknguyen.com).
[Teng Wu](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tengwu2), and 
[Hulya Yigit](https://github.com/hyigit2). The founders present make up the
leadership committee that stewards the organization.

## Mission Statement

The mission of the Urbana-Champaign UseR (UC-UR) group is to foster a 
constructive and collaborative environment for users and developers of the _R_ 
language. We seek to faciliate the free exchange of ideas, developments, and
best practices surrounding _R_ in the Urbana-Champaign area and to the greater
_R_ community at large. Everyone who is interested in _R_ should gain newfound
knowledge by attending.

## Sponsorship

The group is being sponsored by a [vector-level User Group grant](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) from the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).
