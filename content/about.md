The Urbana-Champaign UseR (UC-UR) Group was founded in October 2019 by 
[James Balamuta](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/),
[David Dalpiaz](https://daviddalpiaz.com/), [Ha Nguyen](http://www.haknguyen.com).
[Teng Wu](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tengwu2), and 
[Hulya Yigit](https://github.com/hyigit2). The group was established to promote
and scultivate the usage of _R_ at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). 

## Sponsorship

The group is being sponsored by a [vector-level User Group grant](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) from the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).
