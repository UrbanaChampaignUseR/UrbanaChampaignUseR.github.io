title: Getting Started with R
---

To get started with _R_ consider:

- [Downloading and Installing _R_](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/tutorials/r/downloading-and-installing-r/)
- [Downloading and Installing _RStudio_](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/tutorials/r/downloading-and-installing-rstudio-desktop/)

Alternatively, create an account on [RStudio Cloud](https://go.illinois.edu/uc-ur-rstudio-cloud)
to avoid having to install software.

From there, one of the quickest ways to get started is looking over
[Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/).
